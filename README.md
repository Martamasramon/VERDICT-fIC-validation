# Histological and statistical analysis for VERDICT validation

This project is organised as follows...

## 1. Obtain histologically-derived quantitative maps

Input:
- CSV file with cell density per histo patch
- TXT file with tissue fractions (epithelial, lumen, stroma) per patch

Output:
- 4 histology maps: cell density, epithlelial fraction, lumen fraction, stroma fraction

File:
```1_csv_to_image.ipynb```


## 2. Resize quantitative maps to match downsampled histology 

Input:
- 

Output:

## 3. Compare histology to VERDICT maps using ROIs

Input:
- 

Output:
